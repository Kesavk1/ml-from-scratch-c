# Reconstructing Machine Learning from Scratch in C

A lightweight neural network engine built from scratch in pure C for transparency, control, and embedded applications.

## Features

- Feedforward neural network (1 hidden layer)
- Matrix math from scratch
- Forward propagation
- Easy to extend to support full backpropagation

## Build & Run

```bash
make
./test_nn
